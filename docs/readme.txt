Source Code of Jamella's Diablo 2 Editor
2001-03-17

This source code is my intellectual property. It was completely written
by myself. I have published it so fellow programmers and other
interested people can have a look into the internals of my editor.

If you use parts of the code consider that I needed over half a year to
build this program and mention me in your info box if you like.

Other than that your will find some modifications I made after releasing
version 3.0 of the editor, so don't be surprised if you find some extra
functions and useless pieces of code.

And please don't email me and ask me how the code works, because it does
and I don't have time to teach the whole world object-orientated C++.
Now dig into it by first reading the header file.
